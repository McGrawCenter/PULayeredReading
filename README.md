# conTEXTos
A Wordpress plugin providing functionality to create a multi-layered reading environment. This plugin allows the author to add thematic highlights to readings. These highlights are associated with posts for further information about the portion that is highlighted. 

Once installed, this plugin adds a custom content type called 'Readings' and associated Tags and Categories taxonomies and a widget allowing users to toggle layers of annotation on and off. 

Before adding these highlights, go to Settings and then Layers to define the themes/layers to which those hightlights will be assigned.

Text within those readings may be highlighted and associated with individual posts by clicking the Highlighter button in the Readings editor toolbar. The highlighter tool provides a window in which you may select the theme of the highlight and the post to which it should link.

Note: this added toolbar functionality is only available in the Classic editor at this time.

## Widget
This plugin adds a widget, called 'Layers' that adds a menu of available layers to Readings.
